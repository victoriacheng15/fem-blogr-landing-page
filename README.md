# Frontend Mentor - Blogr landing page solution

The challenge is to build out this [Blogr landing page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blogr-landing-page-EX2RLAApP) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The goals:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
